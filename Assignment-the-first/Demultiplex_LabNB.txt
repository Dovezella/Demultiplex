Assignment the First:
Part I:
Data Exploration:  
located on Talapas:  /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/
    four read fastq files:  R1 - R4, based off which was first sequenced during the Illumina sequencing
        R1 is read one, R2 is index one
        R3 is index two, R4 is read two
    file names:     
        1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz
        1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz
        1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz
        1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz
commands to determine:
number of records in each file:
    ```zcat /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | wc -l``` 1452986940/4 = 363,246,735
    *same for all files
number of bp per read 1/ read 2:
    ```zcat /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | head -n 2 | grep "^G" | wc ``` 101 bp + 1 "\n" for 102 characters in seq line
    ```zcat /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | head -n 2 | grep "^G" | wc ``` 8 bp + 1 "\n" for 9 characters
what does it look like:
    ```zcat /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz | head```

So after exploration, I need to write a script to parse the files to create a histogram of the avg quality scores at each base:
I want to make a sbatch because the files are so BIG! 
I want to use my environment named:  bgmp_py311
    in order to use matplotlib I ```mamba activate bgmp_py311``` then I ```mamba install matplotlib``` accepted default download arguments

I first wrote a python script called basq_hist.py and it is located under /projects/bgmp/dovee/bioinfo/Bi622/Demultiplex/Assignment-the-first
I also moved my current bioinfo module to the same folder, and brought a test file from ps4 to test it with. 
When I tested it:  ```./baseq_hist.py -f pythontestfilefromps4.fastq.gz -o deleteme``` This output a graph called deleteme.png which looked exactly like the one from ps4.

I then wrote a SLURM script called base_qual_hist.sh located in the same working directory.
Command used to run:  ```sbatch base_qual_hist.sh /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R1_001.fastq.gz /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R4_001.fastq.gz```
job number 23559
Percent of CPU this job got: 99%
Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 1:52:31
exit status:  0

In the meantime, I answered Part1, Q2, Number 3:  to find the number indices that have an "N" in the sequences:
```zcat /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R3_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '4~4p' | grep -E "[#]" 
| wc -l``` which returned 3328051
```zcat /projects/bgmp/shared/2017_sequencing/1294_S1_L008_R2_001.fastq.gz | sed -n '4~4p' | grep -E "[#]" 
| wc -l``` which returned 3976613

I was having issues running my base_qual_hist.sh script for all four at a time. 
    potentially due to echo statements, because the python script works and the output looks about right but it doesn't continue to the next file and doesn't echo properly
        so I split it into four scripts to see what was happening
        R1 seems to have worked so i made R2_base_qual_hist.sh, R3_base_qual_hist.sh, R4_base_qual_hist.sh
        jobs 23622, 23628, 23624
        23622:
        	Percent of CPU this job got: 99%
            Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 13:23.63
        23628:
            Percent of CPU this job got: 99%
            Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 13:19.74
        23624:
            Percent of CPU this job got: 99%
            Elapsed (wall clock) time (h:mm:ss or m:ss): 1:34:59
        all exit status 0 and graphs look as I think they should
